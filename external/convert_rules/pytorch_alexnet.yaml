# Rules to import pytorch alexnet pretrained model into checkpoints.

# Some tensors requires us to permute them, as the ordering is different from
# tensorflow.
#
# Convolution:
#     torch:      [out_maps, in_maps, kernel_h, kernel_w]
#     tensorflow: [kernel_h, kernel_w, in_maps, out_maps]
# FC:
#     torch:      [out, in]
#     tensorflow: [in, out]
#
# Additionally, because the ordering of inputs are different between TensorFlow
# [height, width, channels] and PyTorch [channels, height, width], flatten + FC
# requires additional processing.  For instance, AlexNet fc6 in PyTorch uses
# 4096x9216, where 9216 is flattened from 256x6x6.  In order to produce the
# correct spatial ordering in TensorFlow, we need to first unflatten 4096x9216
# into 4096x256x6x6, permute into 4096x6x6x256 and reflatten it to 4096x9216
# and finally permute into 9216x4096.
